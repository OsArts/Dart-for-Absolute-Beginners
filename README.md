Dart for Absolute Beginners
===========================

Source Code for the Apress Book Dart for Absolute Beginners

The source code you'll find here represents all of the major sample programs in Dart for Absolute Beginners (2014, Apress). The source code at the time of the book's publication is also available from Apress.com
This repository will be updated should any of the samples become incompatible with a new version of Dart, unlike the Apress.com version which is frozen in time.

At the time of the book's publication (July 2014), all of the sample programs were running on Dart version 1.5.  I do not foresee them becoming incompatible with any version of Dart to come out in the near future, but please report incompatibilities if you encounter them.
